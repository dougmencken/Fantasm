NOTES ABOUT LOCAL LABELS
========================


1. Entries (generally) marked by "LLBLS-RP200797".


2. Main file is "local_labels.s".


3. Directives/Labels not covered.


	SET	- I don't think this is really any use?
	
	REG/REQU - Yuck! 
		
	RS - Yuck also!
	
	GLOBOFF - Yuck - but how do we tell if its a globoff in the code???? (can't/don't need to)

	EQU - Not currently, but perhaps in the future??
	
	MACRO - Not currently, but perhaps in the future???
	
	

4. "do_pass1_optimised.s" is not in the project, appears older, and therefore has not had
any of the local label changes made to it.


5. The following have specific error checks:

	set
	reg/requ
	equ
	rs
	globoff
	macro
	global (not allowed!)
	extern (not allowed!)
	code toc routines [T]
	
	
	
6. PPC data can now be made 'semi-local' by using a locally defined data label - this
prefixes with a section directive. If no label is used after the section directive, the 
chance of getting two the same == very slim!!!!!!



7. Although stu has a tape saying (in my voice) there will be no bugs with the locals,
I do think (now I've done it) if we don't get bugs, I'll be bloody suprised!!!!



8. All of the above needs very careful testing in a multitude of situations.


9. When the assembler is reporting local labels, they will be prefixed with the local
section name. I suggest we leave this in, and only patch it if it gets on our tits too
much.


10. Both data and code labels can be local, both in PowerPC and 68K.


11. Local labels, (automatically generated prefix) use up 10 characters of the label space
leaving 18 characters.


12. Section directive can be used with or without a subsequent label. Without a label, a 
prefixed is generated, using various magic methods, which is unique (very nearly always). 
Otherwise, the label following is converted into a prefix for all subsubsquent local
labels (until another section directive).


13. Use caution when putting comments after a section directive without a subsequent label
on the same line... always use a semicolon or askerisk......
